# Music to Sheet App

This is a project I worked on with my student daniel that takes an audio file of solo piano and converts it into sheet music. The program was created using the flutter framework with magenta as a backend converter to transform audio to midi then to sheetmusic. This app was published on both the apple app store and the google play store.
